# The Game Space

This is a JavaScript based gaming engine that is designed to give the average consumer the ability to create games in the browser without having to have any prior knowledge of programming.

This engine is aimed at towards being able to generate graphics, import and create new sprites, and simulate physics. It also should be able to give the user the ability to generate a single game that can be played on both desktop and mobile browsers.

At the moment, the engine will be only able to generate 2-D graphics but hopefully will be able to support 3-D graphics down the road.
